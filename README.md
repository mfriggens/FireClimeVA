# FireClimeVA
Interactive version of # 🔥 FireCLIME VA - Web-Based Vulnerability Assessment Tool

A modern, web-based implementation of the Southwest FireCLIME Vulnerability Assessment (FireCLIME VA) tool for evaluating ecosystem vulnerability to fire-climate interactions.

## 📋 Overview

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Pre-work Setup

- Enter site name, location, and assessment details
- Select ecosystem type and climate zone
- Document assessment objectives

### 2. Baseline Assessment

Complete vulnerability scoring for:

**Ecosystem Response Components:**

- Vegetation Type/Structure Response
- Species Composition Response
- Ecosystem Function Response
- Disturbance Response

**Fire Response Components:**

- Fire Frequency Response
- Fire Intensity Response

## 📊 Scoring System

The tool uses a **5-point vulnerability scale**:

|Score|Level                       |Description                                  |
|-----|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|1    |**Highly Resilient/Adapted**|Minimal vulnerability, high adaptive capacity|
|2    |**Moderately Resilient**    |Low vulnerability, good adaptive capacity    |
|3    |**Neutral/Variable**        |Moderate vulnerability, mixed responses      |
|4    |**Moderately Vulnerable**   |High vulnerability, limited adaptation       |
|5    |**Highly Vulnerable**       |Extreme vulnerability, poor adaptive capacity|
